# Compton

Read me for Compton scattering E3 project Code.

Python version used: 3.7.6 Libraries used in code: Matplotlib, Numpy, random, scipy.stats, scipy.optimize.

Files inlcuded in this project:

Compton.py
Includes the experimental data provided by Dr Mark Richards and Dr Steve Kolthammer and the associated plots with these datasets.

Functions.py
Includes all of the functions used in the project. This includes the functions used to analyse the given data (such as linear interpolation function), but also the function responsible for the main simulation of the energy spectrum.

Simulation.py
This includes the collection of data from the Monte Carlo simulation. This mainly includes using the Monte Carlo simulation to obtain an error for the calibration method; this also includes single-source calibration results obtained using the experimental data.
